Introducing Azure Reborn - The reimagined and modernized version of the classic Azure mobile app, now built with the powerful Flutter framework. This source code showcases my expertise in migrating Java-based apps to Flutter and integrating native Java roots to deliver a seamless experience.

With a refreshed design inspired by the latest UI/UX trends, Azure Reborn is not just functional, but also visually stunning. Optimized for Snapdragon 888 and 870 devices, this source code is a testament to my ability to create high-performing and visually appealing mobile apps. 

Check out the design progress on Figma at bit.ly/AzureRebornDesign. 

Get ready to experience a new level of mobile app excellence with Azure Reborn!
